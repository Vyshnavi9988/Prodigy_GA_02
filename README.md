This Python script (task2.py) uses Stable Diffusion via Hugging Faceâ€™s diffusers library to generate realistic AI images from text prompts. It is designed to run in Google Colab or any Python environment with CUDA-enabled GPU support.
Features
Uses Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v1.5 models.

Generates high-quality images from custom text prompts.

Saves and displays the generated image using PIL.

GPU acceleration via CUDA for faster performance.

Supports multiple prompts in a single run. 
 Installation
Before running the script, make sure the following libraries are installed:
pip install diffusers
pip install transformers
pip install torch
pip install accelerate
pip install safetensors
How It Works
Load a pre-trained model
The script supports both CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 and runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 models from Hugging Face.

Device Handling
Automatically uses GPU (cuda) if available; otherwise, falls back to CPU.

Text Prompt
You can customize the prompt to generate different scenes. Example:
prompt = "A quiet path in a moss-covered forest after rain, wet leaves, puddles reflecting trees, natural soft light, DSLR quality"
Image Generation & Saving
The image is generated from the prompt and saved locally:
image.save("generated_image.png")
Display
In Colab or Jupyter environments, the image is displayed inline:
display(image)
